                    My name is Lindsey and I am happily married and the mother of one wonderful son. <br>
                    I have always had an appreciation and aptitude for art; however, life steered me into the sciences and a career as a Biomedical Scientist.

                    After many years I developed severe fibromyalgia and had to stop working. I also discovered that I am autistic. 
                    These life changing discoveries triggered a re-evaluation of everything and I returned to art, telling myself to make one bad piece each day and go from there.
                    Producing art is a wonderful creative and therapeutic outlet and I had long wished to learn watercolour.

                    I can paint from my bed, I can paint in my wheelchair. It has been and continues to be a huge source of joy for me.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    I love nature and the beauty of the outside world and watercolour painting helps me capture what I see in my own unique way.

                    I thank you for looking at my work and I hope you love it as much as I do.
